# INTPROG/Coursework

Introduction To Programming unit coursework for 1st year Computer Science. Includes use of Classes and inheritance and graphics.

Python - "Your task is to write a program to display patchwork samples, an example of which is
illustrated below. The actual patchworks your program will display will depend on your
student number and on the user’s inputs."

"A patchwork sample is made up of patches of two different designs and three colours.
Patchworks are square and can be of three different sizes: 5  5, 7  7 and 9  9."

Java - To develop object-oriented programming skills, including designing, documenting, testing and debugging of Java code.

"Your task is to write a program which models a "pinball machine". The pinball model has some signicant
dierences from its real-world counterpart. In particular, multiple pinballs of dierent types will be used, and
there will be no user control (i.e. this is not a game). The machine contains a variety of objects (pinballs,
holes, and bumpers), which have dierent characteristics, the details of which are given below. The simulation
will end when one of the pinballs falls through the gap at the bottom of the machine. Pinballs collect points as
they interact with particular objects in the machine. Each pinball will have its own score. Once the simulation
is over, the nal score of all the balls is displayed on the screen. The below example shows a pinball machine
with 3 of each type of pinball implemented, 2 bumpers, and 2 holes."
